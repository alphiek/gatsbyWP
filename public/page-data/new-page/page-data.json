It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of &#8220;de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum&#8221; (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, &#8220;Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..&#8221;, comes from a line in section 1.10.32.</p>\n</p>\n<p>The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from &#8220;de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum&#8221; by Cicero are also reproduced in their exact original form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham.</p></p>\n","slug":"new-page","id":"489483e4-ae03-5e67-85df-140a6d5963fe","date":"July 22, 2019"}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"489483e4-ae03-5e67-85df-140a6d5963fe"}}}
