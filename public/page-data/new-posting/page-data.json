It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of &#8220;de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum&#8221; (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, &#8220;Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..&#8221;, comes from a line in section 1.10.32.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from &#8220;de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum&#8221; by Cicero are also reproduced in their exact original form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"http://nick-feltham.xyz/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/lml-tennats-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-348\" srcset=\"http://nick-feltham.xyz/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/lml-tennats-1024x683.jpg 1024w, http://nick-feltham.xyz/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/lml-tennats-300x200.jpg 300w, http://nick-feltham.xyz/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/lml-tennats-768x512.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n"}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"7be63b43-3974-55d2-aa29-d6f12b406e67"}}}
